## Youth Emigration and NEET Trends in Albania (2016â€“2023)

This project analyzes the socio-economic situation of Albanian youth between **2016 and 2023**.  
The focus is on **NEET rates** (Not in Employment, Education, or Training), **youth emigration**, **higher education enrollment**, **population structure**, **wages**, and **asylum applications**.  
The goal is to understand how these factors interact and what story they tell about the challenges young people face in Albania.

## Project Structure

- `data/`
  - `albania_youth_data.csv` â†’ raw dataset  
  - `cleaned_albania_youth_data.csv` â†’ cleaned dataset  
  - `images/`
     - Saved charts and figures for the README  

- `notebook/`
  - `data_cleaning.ipynb` â†’ loads and cleans raw data  
  - `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` â†’ descriptive analysis, correlations, trends  
  - `visualizations.ipynb` â†’ visual storytelling with plots  


## Research Questions

- How has the **NEET rate** evolved from 2016 to 2023?  
- Is there a relationship between **wages** and **emigration of young people**?  
- Does higher **tertiary enrollment** reduce NEET rates?  
- What role do **asylum applications abroad** play in explaining migration trends?  

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** â†’ data wrangling  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** â†’ visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â†’ analysis workflow  

## Key Insights

- **NEET rate (Not in Employment, Education, or Training)** declined from **30% in 2016** to **25% in 2023**.  
  â†’ This indicates gradual improvement in youth integration into education or work, though the rate remains higher than EU averages.  

- **Youth emigration (ages 15â€“29)** decreased sharply from **27,790 in 2016** to **11,948 in 2023**.  
  â†’ While fewer young Albanians are leaving, migration is still significant relative to the population size.  

- **Tertiary enrollment (absolute numbers)** fell slightly, from **141,410 in 2016** to **120,063 in 2023**.  
  â†’ But the **enrollment rate (% of age group 18â€“24)** increased from **55% to 61%**, suggesting that even with a shrinking youth population, more young people are pursuing higher education.  

- **Youth population (20â€“24)** declined steadily from **256,899 in 2016** to **196,240 in 2023**.  
  â†’ This demographic shrinkage reflects both lower birth rates and persistent emigration.  

- **Average gross monthly wages** increased consistently, from **47,522 ALL in 2016** to **70,539 ALL in 2023**.  
  â†’ Despite wage growth, it has not been enough to fully deter emigration pressures.  

- **Asylum applications (ages 15â€“29, % of emigrants)** decreased from **30% in 2016** to **25% in 2023**.  
  â†’ This suggests a shift from asylum-driven migration toward other types of mobility (e.g., work or study migration).  


### ðŸ”Ž Overall interpretation

Albaniaâ€™s youth between 2016â€“2023 faced **contradictory trends**:  
- Education enrollment rates are rising, wages are increasing, and NEET rates are improving.  
- Yet the **youth population is shrinking**, and emigration, while declining, remains a persistent challenge.  

This points to **systemic demographic decline** where opportunities are improving inside the country, but migration remains a strong factor shaping the future of Albaniaâ€™s young population.
